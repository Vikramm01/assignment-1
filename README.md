🧩 Problem Statement

Create a Student Record Management System that allows the user to input, display, and calculate grades for students.

The system should:

Store student details like roll number, name, course, marks, and grade.

Display student records.

Calculate grades automatically based on marks.

Demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

🎯 Objective

To introduce object-oriented concepts, control structures, input/output operations, and arrays/strings in Java.

🧠 Learning Outcomes

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java.

Implement constructors, methods, and basic operations (input/output).

Work with arrays and strings in Java.

Use conditional statements and loops to control program flow.

⚙️ Implementation Details

Language Used: Java

Concepts Covered:

Classes and Objects

Constructors and Methods

Arrays and Loops

Conditional Statements

User Input using Scanner class

💻 Sample Output
Enter number of students: 2

Enter details for student 1:
Roll No: 101
Name: Rohan
Course: BCA
Marks: 85

Enter details for student 2:
Roll No: 102
Name: Neha
Course: BCA
Marks: 73

--- Student Details ---
Roll No: 101 | Name: Rohan | Course: BCA | Marks: 85 | Grade: A
Roll No: 102 | Name: Neha  | Course: BCA | Marks: 73 | Grade: B

🧮 Grade Calculation Logic
Marks Range	Grade
90–100	A+
80–89	A
70–79	B
60–69	C
50–59	D
< 50	F
🚀 How to Run

Save the file as StudentManagement.java.

Open a terminal or IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

Compile using:

javac StudentManagement.java


Run the program:

java StudentManagement

🧾 Conclusion

This assignment demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and basic OOP features in Java. It builds foundational understanding of data handling, input/output, and grade computation logic in a structured way.
